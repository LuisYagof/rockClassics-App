# Rock-Classics APP

## First start JSON-server (mocked database)

To get the mocked database ready:

  - Install JSON Server (`npm install -g json-server`).
  - Navigate with the terminal to the folder `db` into `src`.
  - Start the JSON Server (`json-server --watch db.json`).
  - Now the endpoints are ready to take requests. Keep this server running.

## Development server

- After starting the server, open another terminal inside the root folder of the project.
- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
